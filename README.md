# Mandelbrot set.
This web app uses the library GPU.js in order to render a highly performant image of the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) allowing you to zoom in.

## Todo
For some reason, once you zoom in a certain amount, it becomes pixely. I managed to make a non-gpu version using regular canvas and it was able to zoom in without being pixelated but it was much slower. So I would like to find a way to get rid of the pixelation at a relatively low amount of zoom.

## Contributing
If anyone wants to contribute. Feel free to do so! I've this is the first time I openly ask for contributions so I am not sure how to "properly" structure contributions. So for now, just make a pull request and I'll pull anything that's good. ðŸ¤Œ
